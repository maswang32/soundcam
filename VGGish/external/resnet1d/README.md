# Introduction

PyTorch implementations of several SOTA backbone deep neural networks (such as ResNet [1], ResNeXt [2], RegNet [3]) on one-dimensional (1D) signal/time-series data.

# Usage

```
# test on synthetic data, no data download required
python test_synthetic.py

# test on PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 data
# need prepare data first, or you can download my preprocessed dataset challenge2017.pkl from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AuPxvGoyUbKcVaFmeyt3xsqj6ucWZezf
# Please see comment in code for details
python test_physionet.py

# training or serving model with Ray [4], need install Ray first: https://github.com/ray-project/ray
# Please see comment in code for details
python test_ray.py
```

model_detail/ shows model architectures

In ```trained_model```, we also provide a model ```model.pth``` trained using Challenge 2017 data. The model's parameters is as follows:
```
model = Net1D(
        in_channels=1,
        base_filters=64,
        ratio=1.0,
        filter_list = [64, 160, 160, 400, 400, 1024, 1024],
        m_blocks_list = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4],
        kernel_size=16,
        stride=2,
        groups_width=16,
        verbose=False,
        n_classes=4)
```

We can directly load this model by:
```
model = torch.load('model.pth')
```

# Requirements

Required: Python 3.7.5, PyTorch 1.2.0, torchsummary

Optional: Ray 0.8.0

# Application 1: ECG Classification (PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017)

The initial code has been used in our previous work [5,6,7] for deep feature extraction, which won one of the First place (F1=0.83) of this Challenge. The original tensorflow (tflearn) version can be found at https://github.com/hsd1503/ENCASE . 

Dataset: "AF Classification from a short single lead ECG recording". Data can be found at https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2017/#challenge-data Please use Revised labels (v3) at https://archive.physionet.org/challenge/2017/REFERENCE-v3.csv , or you can download my preprocessed dataset challenge2017.pkl from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AuPxvGoyUbKcVaFmeyt3xsqj6ucWZezf .

This repository also contains data preprocessing code, please see util.py for details.

# Application 2: Health Monitoring in Intensive Care Units (KDD 20)

We built a set of models (called model zoo) for ensemble serving in Intensive Care Units. Please see more at [8].
